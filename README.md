## UPDATING
* If your existing copy has an `options` table - Just override all the existing files and access `index.php`. The installer will take care of database updates (if any).
* If not â€“ Manually import the `options` table from `SQL-iwashere.sql.sql`, create a `IWH_VER` entry with value of `0` and group `0`. Thereafter, just copy the new files and let the installer do the magic.
